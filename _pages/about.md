I have been working as a programmer for nearly 3 years after receiving my bachelorâ€™s degree.
As a passionate jack of many trades, I am eager to learn and use various programming languages, such as Rust, C++, Java, Python, and Lua.
I am also a dead-hearted fan of [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) and [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/).
Compiler technology and [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) attract me a lot, and I also dabble in machine learning, NLP...

In short, I am interested in and willing to try any computer-related technology.

Between 2020 and 2022, I worked for an e-commerce platform called [Pinduoduo](https://m.pinduoduo.com/en/) in China.
That position required the Java stack and provided me with hands-on experience related to e-commerce development.
Right now, I am open to a back-end position focused on business or system development.
