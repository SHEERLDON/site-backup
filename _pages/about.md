I have been working as a programmer for 3 years after receiving my bachelorâ€™s degree.
As a passionate jack of many trades, I am eager to learn and use various programming languages, such as Rust, C++, Java, Python, and Lua.
I am also a dead-hearted fan of [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) and [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/).
Compiler technology and [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) attract me a lot, and I also dabble in machine learning, NLP...

In short, I am interested in and willing to try any computer-related technology.

Now, I am a Rust developer at [Non-Convex Tech](https://ft.tech/), focusing on building easy-to-use trading systems with advanced models.
