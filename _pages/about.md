I am currently a MSc student at the University of Calgary, where I focus my research on wireless communication, UAV-assisted network deployment, 6G, and digital twins under the supervision of [Dr. Qiang (John) Ye](https://qiang-john-ye.github.io/Research.html).

Before pursuing my master's, I worked as a programmer for three years after receiving my bachelor's degree. As a passionate jack of many trades, I am eager to learn and use various programming languages, including Rust, C++, Java, Python, and Lua.

I am a devoted fan of [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) and [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) Arch Linux. I am particularly interested in generative AI, large language models (LLMs), and compiler technology like LLVM. Additionally, I dabble in cloud native and Kubernetes.

In short, I am interested in and willing to try any novel technologies.
